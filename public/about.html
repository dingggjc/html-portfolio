    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As a beginner in web development, I'm a 21-year-old student currently
      pursuing a B.S. in Information Technology. With a genuine interest in web
      development, I am navigating the foundational concepts of HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript as part of my coursework. My learning journey is fueled by the
      excitement of understanding the intricacies of front-end and back-end
      development to eventually create dynamic and engaging websites.

      While I am in the early stages of my web development exploration, I am
      actively seeking resources and tutorials to supplement my formal
      education. This hands-on approach helps me solidify theoretical knowledge
      and gain practical experience in building responsive and user-friendly web
      interfaces. As I embark on this learning path, I am enthusiastic about the
      challenges and discoveries that come with mastering the various tools and
      frameworks that define the web development landscape.
